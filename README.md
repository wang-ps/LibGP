# LibGP

`LibGP` is a header-only C++ library for geometry processing, which was developed during my early Ph.D. career. 

`LibGP` supports my first two papers on geometry processing, including [Rolling Guidance Normal Filter](https://wang-ps.github.io/Pengshuai%20Wang%20-%20Homepage_files/doc/RGNF.pdf) in SIGGRAPH Asia 2015 and [Mesh Denoising via Cascaded Normal Regression](https://wang-ps.github.io/denoising.html) in SIGGRAPH Asia 2016.

The code is released under the MIT license. Feel free to use it and hope it may also be useful for you.
